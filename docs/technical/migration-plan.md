# Multi-Conference Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive migration strategy for transitioning the GIIR Conference System from a single-conference Firebase Realtime Database schema to a multi-conference architecture.

## Migration Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Zero Data Loss**: All existing data must be preserved with complete integrity
2. **Minimal Downtime**: Service disruption must be limited to scheduled maintenance windows
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality must continue to work during migration
4. **Rollback Capability**: Complete rollback plan for each migration phase
5. **Incremental Validation**: Data integrity checks at each migration step

### Migration Phases

#### Phase A: Schema Preparation (Estimated: 2 days)
**Objective**: Prepare new schema structure alongside existing data

**Tasks**:
1. Create Default Conference Entity
2. Implement Dual-Write Pattern  
3. Deploy New Security Rules

#### Phase B: Data Migration (Estimated: 3 days)
**Objective**: Migrate existing data to new multi-conference structure

**Tasks**:
1. User Data Migration
2. Registration Data Migration
3. Paper Submission Migration
4. Configuration Data Migration

#### Phase C: Application Migration (Estimated: 4 days)
**Objective**: Switch application to use new schema while maintaining functionality

**Tasks**:
1. API Endpoint Updates
2. User Interface Updates
3. Admin Interface Enhancement

#### Phase D: Validation and Cleanup (Estimated: 1 day)
**Objective**: Validate migration success and archive old schema

**Tasks**:
1. Comprehensive Testing
2. Data Validation
3. Old Schema Archival

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks

1. **Data Loss During Migration**
   - Mitigation: Complete database backup before starting
   - Detection: Real-time data integrity monitoring
   - Response: Immediate rollback to backup

2. **Extended Downtime**
   - Mitigation: Phased migration with minimal service interruption
   - Detection: Service health monitoring
   - Response: Fast-track rollback procedures

## Timeline and Resources

### Migration Schedule
- **Week 1**: Phase A - Schema Preparation
- **Week 2**: Phase B - Data Migration
- **Week 3**: Phase C - Application Migration  
- **Week 4**: Phase D - Validation and Cleanup

### Success Metrics

#### Technical Metrics
- **Data Integrity**: 100% data preservation
- **Migration Time**: < 4 weeks total duration
- **Downtime**: < 4 hours total service interruption
- **Performance**: < 10% degradation in response times
