# [1-1] Database Schema Design and Migration Plan

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Design and document the Firebase schema structure required to support multi-conference functionality within the existing GIIR Conference System. This task involves analysing the current single-conference Firebase schema, designing a new multi-conference schema structure, and creating a comprehensive migration plan to transition existing data without service disruption.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Schema Analysis**: Document current Firebase schema structure and identify single-conference assumptions
2. **Multi-Conference Design**: Design new schema that supports multiple conferences with separate data isolation
3. **Data Relationships**: Maintain referential integrity between users, registrations, papers, and conferences
4. **Migration Strategy**: Create zero-downtime migration plan for existing data
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues during migration period

### Technical Requirements
1. **Firebase Best Practices**: Follow Firebase Firestore schema design patterns and performance optimizations
2. **Security Rules**: Design security rules that properly isolate conference data
3. **Indexing Strategy**: Plan composite indexes for efficient multi-conference queries
4. **Data Validation**: Define validation rules for conference-specific data integrity
5. **Scalability**: Design schema to handle multiple conferences with varying sizes

### Data Requirements
1. **Conference Isolation**: Each conference must have separate registration, paper submission, and scheduling data
2. **User Association**: Users can be associated with multiple conferences simultaneously
3. **Admin Permissions**: Admin users can have conference-specific or global permissions
4. **Historical Data**: Preserve complete historical data during migration
5. **Audit Trail**: Maintain audit trails for all data modifications during migration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Current Schema Analysis (Estimated: 4 hours)
1. **Document Current Structure**: 
   - Map existing Firebase collections and document relationships
   - Identify hardcoded single-conference assumptions in data structure
   - Document current security rules and indexes
   
2. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Identify all code files that directly interact with Firebase collections
   - Document API endpoints that would be affected by schema changes
   - List template/UI components that display conference-specific data

### Phase 2: New Schema Design (Estimated: 6 hours)
1. **Core Conference Entity**:
   ```
   conferences/{conference_id}
   ├── basic_info: {name, description, dates, status}
   ├── registration_fees: {early_bird, regular, student, etc.}
   ├── settings: {email_templates, review_settings, etc.}
   └── submission_guidelines: {deadlines, requirements, formats}
   ```

2. **Conference-Specific Data Collections**:
   ```
   conference_registrations/{conference_id}/registrations/{user_id}
   conference_papers/{conference_id}/papers/{paper_id}
   conference_sessions/{conference_id}/sessions/{session_id}
   conference_announcements/{conference_id}/announcements/{announcement_id}
   ```

3. **User-Centric Views**:
   ```
   user_conferences/{user_id}
   ├── registrations: {conference_id: registration_summary}
   ├── papers: {conference_id: {paper_id: paper_summary}}
   └── admin_permissions: {conference_id: permission_level}
   ```

### Phase 3: Migration Strategy Design (Estimated: 8 hours)
1. **Migration Phases**:
   - Phase A: Create new schema alongside existing data
   - Phase B: Migrate data incrementally with validation
   - Phase C: Switch application to use new schema
   - Phase D: Archive old schema after validation period

2. **Data Migration Scripts**:
   - Create Firebase Cloud Functions for data migration
   - Implement validation and rollback mechanisms
   - Design progress tracking and error reporting

3. **Zero-Downtime Strategy**:
   - Design dual-write pattern during migration
   - Create feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Plan rollback procedures for each migration phase

### Phase 4: Security and Performance Optimization (Estimated: 4 hours)
1. **Security Rules Update**:
   - Design conference-specific access controls
   - Implement user permission validation
   - Create admin permission hierarchies

2. **Index Planning**:
   - Design composite indexes for multi-conference queries
   - Plan indexes for user-conference relationships
   - Optimize for common query patterns

## Verification

### Completion Criteria
1. **Documentation Complete**: Comprehensive schema documentation with diagrams and examples
2. **Migration Plan Approved**: Detailed migration strategy with timeline and rollback procedures
3. **Security Rules Designed**: Complete security rule set for multi-conference access control
4. **Performance Validated**: Index strategy validated for expected query patterns
5. **Stakeholder Review**: Schema design reviewed and approved by technical team

### Test Plan
This is a design and planning task with the following validation approach:

**Design Validation**:
- Schema design review with senior developers
- Migration plan walkthrough with operations team
- Security rules review for compliance requirements
- Performance impact assessment for expected load

**Migration Plan Testing**:
- Test migration scripts on development database copy
- Validate data integrity checks and rollback procedures
- Simulate migration timeline and resource requirements
- Test dual-write pattern implementation

**Success Criteria**:
- All current functionality can be mapped to new schema
- Migration can be completed within planned downtime window
- New schema supports all multi-conference requirements
- Performance meets or exceeds current system benchmarks

## Files Modified

This task involved comprehensive documentation creation and analysis:

### New Files Created
- `docs/technical/database-schema-design.md` - Complete new schema documentation with current analysis and proposed multi-conference structure
- `docs/technical/migration-plan.md` - Detailed migration strategy with 4-phase approach and risk management
- `docs/technical/security-rules-design.md` - Comprehensive security rules design for multi-conference access control
- `scripts/migration/schema-migration-plan.md` - Technical implementation guide with migration scripts and procedures

### Existing Files Analyzed
- `app.py` - Analyzed 80+ Firebase database references and current schema usage patterns
- `routes/user_routes.py` - Examined user-related database interactions
- `utils.py` - Reviewed utility functions for database access
- `database.rules.json` - Analyzed current security rules and permissions structure
- `firebase.json` - Reviewed Firebase project configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Examined project settings and database configuration

### Analysis Results
- **Current Collections Identified**: 15+ Firebase collections including users, registrations, papers, announcements, etc.
- **Security Patterns Documented**: Current auth-based access control and admin permission patterns
- **Single-Conference Assumptions**: Documented 6 major areas requiring restructuring for multi-conference support
- **Migration Complexity**: Estimated 4-week migration timeline with 4 distinct phases and comprehensive rollback procedures
