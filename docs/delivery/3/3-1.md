# [3-1] Fix Co-author Addition in Paper Submission

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Debug and fix the JavaScript functionality for adding and removing co-authors in paper submission forms. The current implementation may have issues with form field indexing, validation, or data submission that prevent users from properly managing co-authors.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Users must be able to add co-authors to paper submissions
2. Users must be able to remove co-authors without form errors
3. Co-author fields must validate properly (name, email, institution required)
4. Form submission must include all co-author data correctly
5. JavaScript functionality must work on both general and conference-specific submission forms

### Technical Requirements
1. Fix JavaScript array indexing for co-author fields
2. Ensure proper form field naming conventions
3. Implement proper validation for required fields
4. Test form submission with multiple co-authors
5. Maintain compatibility with existing form styling

### Quality Requirements
1. Co-author management should be intuitive and responsive
2. Error messages should be clear and helpful
3. No JavaScript errors in browser console
4. Form should work across modern browsers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Debugging
1. Review existing JavaScript code in paper submission templates
2. Test current co-author functionality to identify specific issues
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify form field naming and indexing logic

### Phase 2: Code Fixes
1. Fix JavaScript functions: `addCoAuthor()`, `removeCoAuthor()`, `updateCoAuthorNumbers()`
2. Correct array indexing and field naming issues
3. Improve form validation logic
4. Test across both submission form templates

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. Test adding multiple co-authors
2. Test removing co-authors from different positions
3. Verify form submission with co-author data
4. Cross-browser testing

## Verification

### Test Cases
1. **Add Co-author Test**:
   - Navigate to paper submission form
   - Click "Add Co-Author" button
   - Verify new co-author fields appear with correct naming
   - Fill in co-author information
   - Verify fields are properly indexed

2. **Remove Co-author Test**:
   - Add multiple co-authors
   - Remove co-author from middle of list
   - Verify remaining co-authors are properly reindexed
   - Check that no JavaScript errors occur

3. **Form Submission Test**:
   - Add multiple co-authors with complete information
   - Submit form
   - Verify all co-author data is included in submission
   - Check database storage includes all co-authors

4. **Validation Test**:
   - Add co-author with missing required fields
   - Attempt form submission
   - Verify appropriate validation messages appear
   - Ensure submission is prevented until all fields are complete

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Co-author addition works without JavaScript errors
- [ ] Co-author removal works and properly reindexes remaining authors
- [ ] Form validation prevents submission with incomplete co-author data
- [ ] All co-author information is correctly submitted and stored
- [ ] Functionality works on both general and conference-specific forms

## Files Modified

Expected files to be modified:
- `templates/user/papers/submit.html`
- `templates/conferences/paper_submission.html`
- Potentially `static/js/main.js` if shared JavaScript is used

## Notes

- Pay special attention to JavaScript array indexing when removing co-authors
- Ensure form field names match the expected format in the backend processing
- Test with both single and multiple co-author scenarios
- Verify that primary author information is not affected by co-author operations
