# PBI-3: System Fixes and UI/UX Improvements

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-3)

## Overview

This PBI addresses critical system bugs and user experience issues that affect the core functionality of the GIIR Conference System. These fixes are essential for maintaining user satisfaction and ensuring all features work as intended.

## Problem Statement

Several key interface components and features have bugs or missing functionality that impacts user experience:

1. **Co-author Addition**: Paper submission forms may have issues with adding/removing co-authors
2. **User Profile Management**: Users cannot edit their personal information from the dashboard
3. **Guest Speakers Display**: Admin interface may not properly display speakers data
4. **Author Guidelines Files**: Download/upload functionality for guidelines templates may be broken
5. **Announcement Images**: Image preview functionality in admin announcements may not work correctly

These issues prevent users from efficiently managing their conference activities and limit administrative capabilities.
