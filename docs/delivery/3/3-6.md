## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. All fixed features must work correctly end-to-end
2. No new bugs or regressions introduced
3. All existing functionality remains intact
4. System performance remains acceptable
5. Cross-browser compatibility maintained

### Technical Requirements
1. Comprehensive testing of all fixed components
2. Regression testing of existing features
3. Performance testing of modified components
4. Security testing of new/modified functionality
5. Integration testing across the system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Individual Feature Testing
1. Test co-author functionality in paper submissions
2. Test user profile editing functionality
3. Test admin speakers management
4. Test author guidelines file operations
5. Test announcement image functionality

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. Test interactions between fixed components
2. Verify multi-conference functionality still works
3. Test user workflows end-to-end
4. Verify admin workflows end-to-end

### Phase 3: Regression and Performance Testing
1. Test existing features for regressions
2. Performance testing of modified components
3. Cross-browser compatibility testing
4. Security testing of changes

## Verification

### Test Scenarios
1. **Complete User Workflow**: Register → Submit Paper → Edit Profile → Download Guidelines
2. **Complete Admin Workflow**: Manage Speakers → Create Announcements → Review Submissions
3. **Multi-Conference Testing**: Verify fixes work across conference contexts
4. **Error Handling**: Test all error scenarios and edge cases

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All fixed features work correctly end-to-end
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] System performance meets requirements
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility maintained
- [ ] Security requirements met
- [ ] All acceptance criteria from previous tasks verified

## Files Modified

This task involves testing, so no files will be modified unless bugs are discovered that require fixes.

## Test Plan

### Comprehensive Test Matrix
1. **Feature Testing**: Each fix tested individually
2. **Integration Testing**: Features tested together
3. **Regression Testing**: Existing features verified
4. **Performance Testing**: Response times and resource usage
5. **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
6. **Compatibility Testing**: Multiple browsers and devices
