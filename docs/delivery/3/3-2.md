## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create user profile editing page accessible from dashboard
2. Allow users to update personal information (name, institution, contact details)
3. Implement secure backend route for profile updates
4. Add proper form validation and error handling
5. Ensure profile changes are reflected across the system

### Technical Requirements
1. Create `templates/user/account/profile.html` template
2. Implement POST route for profile updates in Flask
3. Add form validation for user data
4. Update Firebase user data on successful submission
5. Integrate with existing authentication system

### Security Requirements
1. Ensure only authenticated users can access profile editing
2. Validate user ownership of profile being edited
3. Sanitize and validate all input data
4. Implement proper error handling for security violations

### UX Requirements
1. Provide clear navigation from dashboard to profile editing
2. Show current values in form fields
3. Display success/error messages clearly
4. Maintain consistent styling with existing pages

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Template Creation
1. Create `templates/user/account/profile.html` with editing form
2. Include form fields for user information (name, institution, etc.)
3. Add proper styling consistent with existing pages
4. Implement client-side validation

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
1. Modify existing `/profile` route to handle both GET and POST
2. Add form processing logic for profile updates
3. Implement Firebase user data updates
4. Add proper validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
1. Update dashboard link to profile editing page
2. Test profile update functionality
3. Verify data persistence and display
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Verification

### Test Cases
1. **Profile Access Test**:
   - Log in as regular user
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Click "Edit Profile" link
   - Verify profile editing page loads with current data

2. **Profile Update Test**:
   - Update user information in profile form
   - Submit changes
   - Verify success message appears
   - Check that changes are saved in Firebase
   - Verify updated information displays correctly

3. **Validation Test**:
   - Submit form with invalid data (empty required fields)
   - Verify appropriate error messages appear
   - Ensure invalid data is not saved
   - Test with various invalid input scenarios

4. **Security Test**:
   - Attempt to access profile editing without authentication
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Test that users can only edit their own profiles

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile editing page is accessible from user dashboard
- [ ] Users can successfully update their personal information
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid data submission
- [ ] Changes are properly saved to Firebase
- [ ] Updated information displays correctly across the system
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback is implemented

## Files Modified

Expected files to be created/modified:
- `templates/user/account/profile.html` (new file)
- `app.py` (modify `/profile` route)
- `templates/user/dashboard.html` (update profile link)
- Potentially CSS files for styling consistency

## Test Plan

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Happy Path Testing**:
   - Log in as test user
   - Navigate to profile editing
   - Update each editable field
   - Submit changes
   - Verify updates are reflected

2. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Test with maximum length inputs
   - Test with special characters
   - Test with empty optional fields
   - Test form submission with no changes

3. **Error Handling Testing**:
   - Test with network interruption
   - Test with invalid session
   - Test with server errors

### Security Testing
1. Verify authentication requirements
2. Test cross-user profile access attempts
3. Validate input sanitization
4. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (if applicable)

## Notes

- Consider which fields should be editable (email might require special handling)
- Implement audit logging for profile changes if required by security policy
- Ensure profile updates don't break existing user sessions
- Consider adding confirmation for sensitive changes
- Make sure profile updates work with the multi-conference system
